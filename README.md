### Golden Rules for Success:
* This is a programming course, the emphasis is on you doing lots of programming, exploring a wide range of problems, writing lots of code to ensure you understand all of the course topics, and keeping up with the work each week.
* The student study requirement for this course is **12 hours per week minimum**: most of this time should be spent writing code to solve problems and explore the course topics.
* If you are struggling or fall behind, you may need to do a more than 12 hours per week.
* Start work on Assignments **at least 3 weeks prior to the due date.**
* Ensure the required course software (Java SDK, Netbeans, etc) is installed and you get the practice you need to become comfortable with this as soon as possible. Hint: Week 1.

### Need help:
* Course forums for all tutorial question and course / topic related questions.
* Contact the CC directly if you need help on your assignment.
* **NOTE: Mike O is employed by CQUni for 2 hours per week ONLY - for the tutorial class.**
* I can answer quick questions via email, but long / involved questions should be asked on the course forums or in class.
