* Week 01 - Revision of Java, Github review.    <--- YOU ARE HERE !



*** Primative Types
int
double
char
boolean

int k = 0;

*** Reference Types
String
Date
Employee


String name = "Mike";
Employee emp1 = new Employee (::::::::);


    emp1 ----->   name: <unknown>
                  salary: 0

    emp2 --------> name: Frank
                   salary: 110


*** Object class
The parent of every class / class hierarchy in Java

When we write:
	public class Employee

Java does this behind the scenes:
	public class Employee extends Object


Object o1 = "Mike";

o1 = 123;

o1 = new Date();

"wildcard" data type



@Override

Computer Game
Player
Monster
Scenery - destructible and non-destruct
Non-Player characters

Player p1 = new Player();
p1.addToGameWorld();

Monster m1 = new Monster("Skeleton", 100, 10);
m1.addToGameWorld();

Override can save your bacon when you are dealing with complex projects, lots of classes and methods.
